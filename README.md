## Background
A capsule wardrobe is typically thought of as a small coordinated collection of clothing (exclusive of workout clothes, underwear, and pajamas) that allows the wearer to be more mindful of clothing purchases and to reduce decision fatigue.  This also enables to person to wear their favorite clothing more often.  The items in a capsule wardrobe should be carefully selected to maximize the number of possible outfit combinations. Capsule wardrobes are tailored for a particular season, so that a person has multiple capsules throughout the changing seasons, but only uses one capsule per season.

## About
Capsule is a web app tool for visualizing and building a capsule wardrobe.  In Capsule, we consider a capsule wardrobe to include a maximum of 33 articles of clothing, including accessories, shoes, and outerwear.  An image focused design allows users to see, at a glance, what items they have in a particular capsule.  A user can either create their own article to add to their capsule, or select an existing article from the Capsule database.  

## Technical Design
